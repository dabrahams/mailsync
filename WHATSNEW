New in 4.5:

 * Simulate option
 * fixed mapage

New in 4.4.4:

 * Check every fetch operation for success
 * documented the fact that mailsync is not really fit for concurrent
   mailbox access
 * extended loging
 * reengineering - clearer naming of variables (I hope)
                 - int msgno -> unsigned long msgno (as in c-client)
                 - functions and variables that return/contain only true/false
                   are now booleans

New in 4.4.3:

 * do not copy deleted mails

New in 4.4.2:

 * documented list mode
 * list mode can display contents of mailboxes
 * more docu
 * reordered code to make it more coherent (IMHO)
 * various functions (fetch_mail_ids, tdc_mail_open) had too many crucial
   side effects which made the code very hard to follow. Untangled that.
 * closing a stream before writing in it (c-client logic!) so that new
   messages are not marked as seen. That means, that mutt users should be
   happy(er?) now.

New in 4.4.1:

 * more explicit and consistent error messages, more sensible debug output
 * documented the code and renamed stuff so that it makes sense
 * messages-ids are sanitized and saved in RFC822 format only.
 * warnings about spaces in the message id are now optional, see the "-bd"
   option
 * fixed a bug that occured when files were copied over but could not be saved
   for some reason

New in 4.2.3 to 4.3.1:

 * bugfixes, docu fixes - see debian/changelog

New in 4.2.2:

 * password can be set in stores/channel

New in 4.2.1:

 * recursive copying should work now

 * comments in config files

 * minor bugfixes and cleanups

New in 4:

 * If the same new message is in both stores, it's left alone.
   (mailsync-3 would copy it in both directions, wasting bandwidth and
   creating duplicates).

 * Now makes a single pass through each mailbox instead of two.  This
   reduces network bandwidth (though probably only a little, not by 50%).

 * Can handle either or both stores being empty.

 * List mode ("mailsync store") and diff mode ("mailsync store
   channel") fixed.  Diff mode no longer removes duplicates.

 * The per-mailbox summary lines ("foo: 1 deleted, 30 remain") now
   appear before the copying & deleting are done.  So if you see 
   "foo: 4384 copied local->remote" you can hit ^C sooner.

 * Now mailsync is a C++ program.  Reduced from 2000 lines of code to
   1200.  Data formats (.mailsync and msinfo) remain unchanged.  Fewer
   memory leaks and less opportunity for buffer overflows (though I don't
   know of any in mailsync-3).
