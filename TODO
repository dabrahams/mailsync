* unless run wit -D a once existent folder will allways be
  recreated because mailsync remembers it in it's .minfo store.
  How to reproduce:
  * create folder F
  * store some file there
  * sync
  * remove F on both sites
  * sync
  * F will be recreated on one site :-/

* Better error handling (if there's an IMAP error mailsync just
  quits)

* clean up

* integrate current_context_passwd better with c-client calls

* refuse to run if .mailsync contains password and permissions are wrong

* %Warning: replaced blanks with . in <3D523C9E00175E83@mta11n.bluewin.ch>.(added.by.postmaster@bluewin.ch)

* on the first run the inbox on the remote machine is deleted?
  test with tpo2!

* mailsync.c:392: warning: passing `const char *' as argument 3 of `die_with_fatal_parse_error3(Token *, char *, char *)' discards qualifiers
  don't know what to do of this - had to use -fpermissive :-(
