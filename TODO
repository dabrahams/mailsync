You're wellcome to implement any of these
-----------------------------------------
* unless run wit -D a once existent folder will allways be
  recreated because mailsync remembers it in it's .minfo store.
  How to reproduce:
  * create folder F
  * store some file there
  * sync
  * remove F on both sites
  * sync
  * F will be recreated on one site :-/

* Better error handling (if there's an IMAP error mailsync just
  quits)

* integrate current_context_passwd better with c-client calls

* refuse to run if .mailsync contains password and permissions are wrong

* test and/or find better solution to the problem when encountering a mailbox
  that does not match our default mailbox delimiter

* mailsync can't handle mailboxes that contain messages _and_ submailboxes

* why do some errors go to stderr and some to stdout?

* ideally sanitize_message_id should not have a side effect, but just
  return 1 or 0 if the message had to be modified or it should have
  enough information to print a sufficient error message, i.e. the
  mailbox where the message is originating from

* I'm not sure whether extra mailboxes in read_lasttime_seen and delete_boxes
  in write_lasttime is consistent

* mailsync is using '!'  as a hierarchy separator. This is unfortunate. IMAP 4rev1
  says mailbox names should be encoded in "modified UTF-7" that is contain only
  characters 0x20-0x7e. That means we should use a non-"modified UTF-7" character
  as hierarchy separator for mailsync ideally a character that has special meaning
  on all platforms as f.ex. newline?

* no_expunge runtime/compile option don't mix?

* Displaying "=?iso-8859-1?Q?Susanne" in Subject or From: is nonsense

Nice to have
------------
* it'd be nice to know which driver c-client will use for accessing mail

* synchronize Status

* move CLI options into config file
